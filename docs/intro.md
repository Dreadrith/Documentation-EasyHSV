# Getting Started

Common prerequisites, how to import and how to open it.

## Prerequisites
- Unity Editor 2019/2022
- VRChat Avatars SDK
- Purchased [EasyHSV](https://dreadrith.gumroad.com/l/easyhsv)

## How to Import
After purchasing, you can import the package through VRChat's Creator Companion (VCC) or the UnityPackage:
- VCC (Recommended):
	- If you don't have VCC, download it from [here](https://vrchat.com/home/download) and install it.
	- Click the "Add To VCC" button included in your purchase. This will add it to your VCC and allow you to import it to your project through VCC.
	- VCC is recommended as it makes it easier to keep up with updates.
- UnityPackage:
	- Download the UnityPackage included with your purchase.
	- Drag and drop the UnityPackage to your project or double click the package.
	- Import everything included in the package.

## How to Open
After importing the package, wait till Unity's processing finishes. If you have errors or encounter errors while importing, then they need fixing before proceeding.  
To open EasyHSV's window, find and click `DreadTools > EasyHSV`. It's in the top in Unity's toolbar.
